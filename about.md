title: About Me
description: This blog has been initiated for a Data Science class I am attending at General Assembly in NYC. This is my very first blog and, like all the other firsts I've been covering since September, it is both exhilirating and terrifying.

### Contents
This will be a record of my journey through the projects assigned weekly for my course. Hopefully it can capture some of the borderline insanity I feel during each project. I will most likely retroactively include my first project as well.












### Acknowledgements
I reverse discovered every portion of how to properly do this blog via the creator of the theme I forked from github. His name is Cole Townsend and I hope he somehow knows how very much I learned looking over his code. 
The theme was called Balzac which intrigued me because I enjoy the author's prose. Upon seeing the actual theme, I fell for the soothing quality of it. I hope anyone reading this enjoys it as much as I do.
